1,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is like a normal android..not an OnePlus..Low processing, Exceptional features of OnePlus are not there in this phone..Took so long time to delete items..Battery is draining fast..Charging is not as fast as claimed..Earlier I was using OnePlus 5T..I bought it to upgrade but unfortunately it degrades...",Verified buyer,It is not OnePlus
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best part of the phone is it's super simple and user friendly operating system. Camera doesn't oversaturate colours and captures decent photos. Battery charging is super fast. People argue that this is overpriced in this segment but I guess ease of using the phone and mainly the OS wouldn't be so good in other comparable phones. It is super light and handy. Cheers,Rohit M,Good overall
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Performance is really good - no lags at allPerfectly smooth user experience.COD gaming - quality medium, frame rate max - fps 57-60.Quality high, max frame rate - fps - 45-58Battery easily lasts more than one day with 1 hour gaming and 2-3 hours YouTube/Netflix etc.Super fast charging.Cameras are good too.Not as good as pixel 4a but almost 90% as good.Single speaker is a let down, but still enough loud.No ois but software stabilization is good.Overall, very satisfied with the phone.Really enjoying using the phone.Simply trust OnePlus, they know how to make good phones.",Subhrajit Pyne,Smooth user experience

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. 😅 One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth 🤤 It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best 🤞",Sunil Pareek,the best 🤞

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. While the omission of the alert slider is baffling, everything else seems good for the price.

11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all thanks to Amazon to deliver my phone so fast and in very good condition.I recieved my first ever OnePlus today morning.As NORD was one of the hits , I can see Nord CE is on the same way.In Box :SmartPhone with Adapter and Red Cable, super transparent case for phone and some manual stuff.Physics : Can be handle by one hand easily, nice grip , not much slim as shown but fits perfectly in hand. Feels bit weighted not as described by Oneplus.Display is AMOLeD so feels good . Response time is 0.2ms . Fingerprint Scanner works well.Software : SnapDragon 750G is preety good. Good for moderate users. UI is same as other OnePlus models so not much difference.Missing NeverSettle logo on screen.Camera quality is much better than any other phone in this price range.Front as well as rear.Sound quality is good but could have been better, I must say its very loud.Battery :Did my first charge , took 22mins approx to go 100% from 39%.Will update after 2-3 days about battery performance once I play couple of games on it.Rest depends on phone , mine is 12GB 256 GB variant so lots of space which comes with additional 5Gb bree Cloud by OnePlus can be extended to 1TB if needed.Phone is awsome in such low price range.Go for it without thinking in 25K range.Awsome wok OnePlus !! Thanks .",Ajit Thakur,Fab !!
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have one plus six purchase in 2018. It was working fine with no issue. I always have interest on 5 G phone and this was purchase during Amazon sell. The delivery was smooth in one day. The phone has transparent cover no need to purchase any cover. The wireless data , apps, contact transfer between two android phone is so smooth , one should always try while setting the new phone ( both phone should have wifi / SIM card. The phone is much lighter , fingerprint sensor working smooth, fast browsing,  the two specific feature I want to mention , one is battery back up ( more than one day ) and another is excellent picture quality which are the main attraction. I am having I phone 11, but the picture quality is far superior. The discount I received from HDFC as well as Amazon.

Rear camera works fine, no issues with that but front one😭😭, my money just got wasted.19 Jun- By look, it is awesome, feels good in hand, light weight but I personally wanted a good camera which it doesn't have especially selfie camera, not happy with the front camera, rear camera is fine, not that bad.",Myra,Disappointed due to camera

Then go for it without any thought..all the negative feedback is just fake.  You will know that after using it.These negative commenting critics expect to have  everything in a phone at 23k.

I went ahead with the phone because my usage is pretty basic, I don't game much and I am on a budget. Plus, I've used oneplus phone before thus the blind trust. (Fingers crossed)Review: The delivery was timely by Amazon.The phone set up was easy and quick.All the cameras are just above average. (Pictures, selfies and videos too)No heating issue experienced so far.Charging is fairly quick. (Wouldn't say as promised)The display is nice and bright.The bluetooth connectivity is quick.Audio is loud enough but just one speaker at the bottom. It has an audio jack too!Network connectivity is good (in my area)I like the build quality, it's thin. The blue color is unique in a way. (Blue shade gets darker on the edges)So far no regrets.

86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So here is my review after 3 days of monitoring performance and overall experience. I am first time one plus user. Always wanted to try one plus . I am a samsung lover and also iphone user. For me comfort, ease and technologically advanced features matter the most. This phone is very well in all these aspects. I have medium to high usage. Call and texts throughout the day. Checking websites making notes, social media usage is high too. With my old phone samsung A50 I could get issue with battery by the time it is 7pm  to 8pm but with this phone it survives well till 12am too. Not sure if it is genuinely fast charging as haven't got a chance to charge in hurry or so.The touch is very smooth and finger print sensor is marvelous. The look, specially the back is gorgeous. Rest it looks very similar to my old phone. Same height and thickness too the same. It was also this light and slim and had similar edges. Though this one is not glass back, it still looks premium with some kind of hard material.Camera is too good. Took some random pics staying came out really great. At night pics were little grainy bt I guess it's with every phone. Didn't happen to go anywhere in sunlight so no idea abt those kinda pics.I need to get acquainted to some differences in this oxygen os bt rest due to one plus switch I was able to transfer everything including my call logs from previous phone.Phone is fast reliable and camera is great. Looks I would give 10 on 10.With no cost emi and hdfc 1000 off, the 12gb model is really a budget model with all amazing features.Will update the review after few months!",Krupal d.,Phone is fast reliable and camera is great.

Biggest cons I believe is Battery which drains so fast..with normal usage as well it won’t last for a day.3. Expensive, base variant should have been start with 19k.",AP,Mobile is OK but battery drains so fast
108,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So I'll get straight to the point.. This is an excellent phone for people who haven't used one plus phones and want to try out a new OS.But it's a bad option for people who think of switching over to this from another one plus model.1) Frankly the battery charging time claimed by one plus is completely bogus. It takes around 1 hr to charge it to 50% and more than 1.5 hr to charge it completely. And it discharges fairly quickly too. With just around 2.5 hrs of screen on time and 15 hrs of standby time my battery went from 100% charged to 20% which is really poor.2) the camera quality is good enough for capturing in outdoor sunny conditions even though the pictures are a bit overexposed. Not good for low light.3) OS is excellent and clean. I have 6gb model and around 123 apps installed and it hasn't lagged so far.4) very good for one hand use specially because of all the gesture/swipe features.5) gaming is good enough. Because of the slightly older cpu you can play games like pubg at 30fps.6) screen quality is beyond words exceptionally good. Love the in display fingerprint scan albeit a little slower.7) the always on display feature is pretty good. Doesn't consume much battery coz it's amoled and the black pixels don't consume much power.8) for people who haven't used alert slider on one plus phones before, you are not missing out on anything. You can't know the difference when you haven't used it right?9) one thing I discovered was the if you turn in the flashlight, you can see the entire edge of the phone light up. You can see the picture. Now I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. Proves it's definitely not a water repellent phone.10) one really weird thing is that on this phone the company forgot to give (yes forgot!) an option for making your Bluetooth discoverable by other devices so you can't find this phone on any other device. You will have to manually pair this phone by making the other device discoverable.Verdict : apart from the fact that it's a little overpriced for the features they are giving you, and the battery and other minor issues which can be solved if the company decides to give an update, leaving all this aside, I'm pretty happy with the experience. Coz at the end of the day isn't that what you're paying for? The experience of using a one plus device?",Ayush Kamal,Not perfect.. But getting there.

112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Below are my thoughts after using this phone for a week. Hope it would be helpful for you buyers. Uploaded photos in all the modes.*What I like best*1. Very handy and a premium look at this price.2. Design and shape is awesome.3. 90hz display is as fast as it can.4. Fingerprint unlock is too good.5. Features like dark mode, vision comfort are also very helpful as per the light in your surrounding.6. Light weight and slim.7. Camera performance, especially in daylight is very good. Night mode is very clear and original.8. Battery back up is awesome and gets fully charged in hardly 45 mins.9. Speakers are also good with a great output.10. Best part is 3.5mm jack, which is missing in original Nord. :-)*What could have been better*1. Camera could have been more better during dim light. Still its good at this price.2. Back body is made of cluster of different materials and doesn't feels that premium as compared to original Nord (I used original Nord before this). Well that's what they did to reduce the weight in this product, else glass material like nord is always bulky.3. Photos taken above 2x will blur a little bit (hardly noticeable) and won't be that clear once zoom in.OVERALL, A VERY GOOD QUALITY AND PREMIUM PHONE AT THIS PRICE WITH ONE+ AS A BRAND.Please like the review if it's helpful.Thanks and have a wonderful buying on #Amazonisthebest",Suhaib_Xception,Premium phone in low price
113,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is a total disappointment. I had been using OnePlus 5T for over 3 years and the phone was working brilliantly with no flaws in performance whatsoever. Hence, decided to stick with the OnePlus brand and bought the Nord CE5G. However, this is nowhere close to my old phone and has multiple issues. Deleting of files on gallery takes forever, proximity sensor is faulty prompting you to mute yourself in between calls, jiotv doesn't work and the touch performance is below par. I would not recommend this phone to any existing OnePlus user!",Chetsj,Disappointed!

119,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After using Oneplus 3 for almost five years, I bought this phone and really disappointed.1. Camera is below average like any other cheap phone, doesn't seem like 64mp at all. Triple camera certainly not doing it's job well.2. Despite of having a 4500mAh battery, it gives same backup as 3000mAH battery.3. Finger Scanner is an another disaster, takes more than a second to open. Where as oneplus 3 had much faster response.4. Colors seems off for some reason. Even Customize color setting is also not helping.5.Why the hell they removed Slider Switch which is there in all oneplus phones. Another level of stupidity.Over all I am totally unsatisfied with this model of oneplus, they have surely entered into money making business than giving good phones to the customer.",Dipesh R. Pandit,Big Disappointed from Oneplus.
120,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The entire phone rides on the Oxygen OS. I personally am an OnePlus fan boy and have been using OnePlus since OnePlus 3. I switched from my 3 year old OnePlus 6 to Nord CE and to me, it feels like an upgrade. Battery life is fantastic and you can look at this gorgeous display all day long. I am missing the alert slider since I have been used to it, otherwise everything works like a charm. Vibration motor feels extremely cheap, but I am person who doesn't use haptic feedback so it didn't affect me much.Over-all, I would recommend this phone to people who appreciates clean and stock android. Definitely not a value-for-money device",Karthik,OnePlus experience at an affordable price!

124,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this phone by exchanging my old OnePlus 6T. Got only 9250/- for exchange which felt bad. The only thing I saw is 5GDisplay: 5/5 looks soo cool and touch is also very smoothBattery: I'm charging it only for once in a day with random average usage. With one full charge I'm able to use for more than a day. Warp charge is also good 5/5 for battery bbackupCharger: The main drawback on OnePlus is the charger size. It is difficult to use as portable charger because of it's big sizze. I wish OnePlus charger size will be shrink some day. 2/5 for charger sizeProcesser: Not soo good. Even deleting pics also takes few sec of time. After using OnePlus 6T I felt this as drawback. 3/5Gaming: haven't played bigger games yet 8 ball pool runs good.Camera: Selfie camera is not good. It is only single 16mp camera. 3/5Rear cam: Not that great. Previous OnePlus nord which has 48mp cam clicks better images than this. 3/5Finger print sensor: Faster than my old OnePlus 6TPhone is very light weight and slim to carry5/5 for mobility.Over all it's a good phone for this price in this brand,vinil,Best budget OnePlus phone

It keeps changing brightness in every second5. Wifi doesn't work in between. Speedtest app shows 150 Mbps speed and still the apps and pages keeps loading and loading6.

130,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I pre ordered the phone on 11th and got it on 17th June, the delivery was great from both the amazon and their delivery partner. Now lets talk about the phone1.The display- The display is mind blowing, the best under this segment, I know it does not have 120hz display but that 90hz display with oxygen os gives an awesome experience and if you use it once i am sure that you are gonna love it. For display I will give it 5/52.Built quality- Built quality is great, even though its not metal or glass, it feels very premium. Its very lightweight and handy which is really help full. For built quality i will give it 4/5.3.OS- Oxygen OS is the best operating system that i have ever used in my life. I have used miui then one ui but after using Oxygen os i feel like those are just crap. The experience you will get by using oxygen os cant be described in words. The main reason behind buying this phone was oxygen os. For os i will give it 10/5 [5 marks extra for bloat free and add free os 😅😅😆😆]4.Camera- For me camera was a bit disappointing , even having so great lenses it wasn't able to stand on my expectations but i know oneplus will fix it with future updates so i don't have to worry about it as i know they really fix it. I have installed 2 updates till now and i have seen that the camera is getting better but not the best, so waiting for more future updates to make the camera best. For camera i will give it 3.5/5.5.Processor- It gets the snapdragon 750g processor which is really great for moderate as well as a little heavy usage. I played BGMI on it for continuously for 2 hours but the phone did not overheated, the heat was negligible and i was shocked to see it, and for moderate its the best. For processor i will give it 5/5In the end i will just say that Oneplus Nord CE is a great phone and if you are looking for a phone, you can blindly go for it. Overall i will give this phone 4.5/5.",Spandan das,A great phone but need updates to make it the best

I have used OP 2 and OP 5T as my primary devices over the past 5 yrs with breif stint with iphone 6 and 8 in between until I handed them over to my spouse and got back to OP.Was in the market again for a phone when my OP5T went out of support and corporate apps stopped working on the same. All the online reading painted a very -ve picture of OP from 2020 and beyond. As an early adopter of OP I too felt that the flagship phones aren't as accessible as they used to be. The OP9R seemed as a good option, but then again when I did the compared the cost to performance difference of the OP9R and OP Nord CE, I felt CE was good enough to do my daily tasks.I am not a gamer, most of my use revolves around mails, conference calls, social media, multi tasking.

Also the position of the camera is a bit weird so I have to hold phone a bit tilted to get my face in the middle of the screen-Video stabilization is not up to the mark. I wish they included OIS.-no stereo speakers but okay for me as I always use earphones, still sound quality is not too bad.But one thing that really bothered me is that selfie camera is giving really bad picture quality during video calls through WhatsApp and other similar apps.

Ultrawide angle camera is good i can say , but we cannot take photos as always in ultrawide , the main camera such a pathetic when you focus on ur face after get clicked results are so poor that make ur face all black nd pixels burst.. No doubt selfie camera is caputuring good image but as we all know its a one plus brand so didnt expect this from the Brand.  I switched to one plus after ages nd now already returner it no more needed this Nord CE.. Attaching some night pictures as you can imagine in low light it makes quality so cheap .. Main camera image is first one and second is from ultrawide.",Karan,Not worth it

171,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been waiting to buy a new phone from quite some time and it's sad to see all those efforts wasted. The time spent on seeing unboxings, reviews and opinions. In short, this is not the phone I was looking for.Pros:1. Overhyped OxygenOS.2. Battery (slow drain, quick charge)3. No ads (only Netflix app and few OnePlus apps)4. Earphone jack audio (seriously we have to praise the companies now for getting just the basics right)5. Call quality.6. Good RAM management7. Good form factor and lightweight.Cons:1. CAMERA- Tap to focus is a joke on this device. Sharpening is less than bare minimum. Basically the photo output is not smooth like few phones out there but actually bad, low quality, especially from the front camera. Front camera doesn't even have pinch to zoom. Using rear camera, when you look at the photo you're clicking in viewfinder you will get a feel that the photo is going to look good. When you click it and see the pic you find the photo is blurry. This device needs additional 2-3 seconds time after shutter sound comes to click a normal image. Even after doing it when you open the photo you see immediately that it's probably a good photo but in just 2 seconds background processing changes the image, makes details and sharpening go away and terrible white balancing occurs. This is the case of highly promoted 64MP sensor. Now ultrawide actually needs an ultrasound to figure what's wrong with it. Frankly if you open ultrawide camera in artificial lighting, it'll look like a VGA camera on keypad phones we used to have earlier.Not even remotely expecting OnePlus cameras to challenge the might of Pixel series, but a decent package of a phone should have had a decent camera, no?Camera doesn't need optimization, but a complete overhaul. People at OnePlus need to sit down and think where they went wrong.2. Wifi connectivity is very problematic, for multiple times a day it'll lose connection and show no internet access. If you check with another phone, speed will be normal.2. Some framedrops here and there.3. Caller was not showing incoming call, just ringtone. Phone app needed cache and storage clearing to get it to work.4. OS is not managing the corner content, not sure if it is limited to this device but can be checked by going to fast.com and seeing whether ""Powered by Netflix"" is clearly visible or not in bottom corner.5.Seamlessness in WhatsApp, sharing photo and attaching a GIF in the same photo as caption doesn't seem to work and takes us back to WhatsApp home screen.6. Lack of feature is not really a con but stereo speakers and expandable storage would have been welcome.7. You will get not-value for money vibes from this device several times a day.I really wish Amazon had return policy still functioning with phones.OnePlus promoted this phone as : ""A little more than you expect."" Well I expected a less troubling phone.",Anshuman,Save your money do not buy out of hype.

You might feel battery drop in first 1/2 charging but after that it goes smooth.Mobile cover provided is of very good quality and fits tight.Camera quality is good I have posted some photos herewith, yes some may feel minor issues in optimisation, but it might surely go after update.Slider is missing which was became a mark of one plus, but I personally don't bother about it as I don't know how frequently I was going to use it.",Pratham y,Very good Quality and build go for it

Even the mobiles which cost less than 8k take good pictures and ofcourse the quality of the front camera is even worse .

Video capture is still fine but not upto mark.Display: AnnoyingLight on the display is auto adjusted. It goes dark and it goes bright on its own irrespective whether you need it or not.

They should recall it if they want their reputation to be safe.,STAR FAB,Disappointing OnePlus Product
192,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well after a lot of research and nail biting I finally decided to go for this phone. Previously I was using a OnePlus 3 and thought this would be a good upgrade but sadly it's just another device. It lacks the whole OnePlus feel in certain areas. I have been using this device for a week now and it's safe to say OnePlus tried to do something extraordinary but it's just another device which lacks the efficiency that my OnePlus 3 still packs. But over-all if you are looking for a decent looking phone under a strict budget then go for it.Battery- It easily lasts a day. I don't play games  at all but it's mostly calls and work related things stuff. Charging is not as fast at all. It takes a lot of time to charge.Performance- Performance is smooth. Multitasking is well handled. Ram management is efficiently handled.Display- Display is good. The screen size is actually pretty huge. They have claimed that users can use it single handed but honestly it's a bit difficult. The 90hz refresh rate does do its thing efficiently. Overall crisp and clear display.Network- Network connectivity is good. Voice calls are clear. It also has wifi calling which makes it easier when we have poor network providers.Camera- This is the part where OnePlus could have done better. It lacks soo many things clarity, sharpness, colour rendering ( in a few shots). I haven't tried the night mode yet but pretty sure it would be just normal and not extraordinary. The front camera also lacks clarity, Sharpness and the pictures come out grainy. Under good lighting the camera does perform good but overall I think they need a major update on this one.Os- It runs android 11 out of the box which is a good thing. There is something lacking in this OS. I still prefer my OnePlus 3 for this. Oxygen OS needs to pull up to get back in the game. No doubt it's smooth, it's customisable, has no bloatware but still it lacks a punch.Unlock- Fingerprint unlock is fast. Face unlock also works perfectly fine.This phone has a few bugs that I found out.1) Bluetooth keeps switching on by itself.2) There is a delay in the notification if the screen is locked.3)Battery does not drain in standby but once you use it immediately after it, it drains quickly.4) Incoming call notifications still remain even though you disconnect the callOverall if you have a tight budget, you could go for it. It delivers the performance that the brand suggests but still a lot of things could have been improved.",Beejoy Venkkat,Honest Review after a week's usage
193,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sharing my experience of New Oneplus Nord 5g.Disappointing Front Camera! Pathetic!Was expecting a good performance from premium brand like One Plus.

Good battery backup specially if you use it in the auto dimming mode. Feather touch. Display is big enough and slim. The phone is made of plastic...to some it may look cheap but trust me you would hate heavier phones in you trousers after using this. The camera is not bad either. Quality of photos are as good as Redmi Note 10. Yet the RAM and the Internal memory is the best you can get in this segment. Think something... Many of our phones have suffered lags due to heavy data in its system. One plus has given this issue foremost importance. A gamer would love this set due to its battery life.. good sensors and equally good performance. I bet you would not get any better at this price. This is a must buy. One Plus should gift me a Bluetooth smartwatch seeing its sales increase because of my review. Anyways thank you one plus. I have a beast in my pocket now.,Sounak,Value for Money

The main reason why we chose Nord over the other phones. Turned out, its camera is a disaster—too soft l, pale, and tinted images. Nighttime/low light videos, don't even think about it. Feelings for this phone went upside down just because of the camera quality. This 25k phone is worse than a 7-8k phone in terms of images and videos it can produce.

Not sure why there was a delay in delivery, but if this is how things are then it might be difficult for people to buy phones , especially those needing it urgently.Delivery delays aside , here are my insights about the phone so farLikes:1. Weight distribution of the phone is good and form factor feels compact.2. Blue void seems to be the most preferred color for most buyers out there.3. Inclusion of a 3.5 mm headphone jack is a boon.4. Little aggressive, compared to previous gen Nord in terms of pricing.5. Brighter 90hz AMOLED panel at Full HD.6. Decent battery, though yet to see how much it could sustain in long run.7.Smooth Oxygen OSDislikes:1. Absence of Alert Slider, something that made OnePlus phones stand out from other Android phones.2.Lack of basic Ingress Protection and absence of Gorrila glass protection, where other brands have both or either one of them in place.3. Dirac Audio tuning was not at all mentioned in feature list which was disappointing.4. Snapdragon 750G  feels like underpowered when compared to another competitor in Iqoo z2 (sister concern) which has a newer chip.5. Warp charge 30T tends to charge the phone slower (not sure if it's due to high thermals , but was slow ).6. Average cameras.7. Single 5G band for Indian Subcontinent (N72), which is restricted only for defence purposes . Heck even a lower prices Moto G 5G gave 10 different 5G bands while introducing SD 750G.Overall:You can purcahse OnePlus Nord CE 5G if,A.

If you use it for video call or gaming the phone is heated up quickly. This version of one+ is just defaming one+ or you can say the deterioration of one+ started. This is my first experience of any one+ and earlier I heard that one+ is like Apple for those who is really concerned about budget. But this experience of one+ really disappointed me.,Sourav Chakraborty,Not upto the mark
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first time I am writing my review for a phone.I have used samsung, Redmi, and MiAll the phones had similar issues - Bad camera, Battery Issues and Storage issues.So this 1plus phone is far better than the above.Pros:- Excellent Camera- Storage Capacity- automatic gaming or reading mode- Connects to 5g- User friendlyCons- Need to charge everyday for 90 mins.- Battery drains out quickly but much better than the above listed brands.- Pretty heavy- Slightly Expensive but negligible considering I got a good exchnage and cash back.Overall I am happy with my phone.",Jayant I.,My first phone review

220,4.0 out of 5 stars,I got it for 23 k for 8 128 gb variant. This is my first one plus handset when I  unlocked it I felt I'm using a premium phone.*It definitely has a premium software however there are small lags in the UI.But it is better than the likes of miui and other custom os.*Camera is pretty decent when you have alot of light but things are not the same for the low light camera.You need to keep the phone steady if you shake it it will produce blur images and it's annoying.😡*Battery is probably the biggest plus point of the device even with 90hz it passes my day.It sometimes crushes black in Netflix.😡Call quality is amazing.*I played cod and it plays well with upto 60fps.BGMI - haven't played it yet but saw few youtubers playing it at 30 fps.Also the phone is super slim light weight the other pav kg ugli phones.,Mohamed umair,Loved it
221,2.0 out of 5 stars,1st time buying oneplus phone and very disappointed. I have return this product.I giving 2 star because of os and display. Other then nothing better in this phone.

223,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Its not that bad to be honest. Phones worse than this have better rating. It is suffering because the other phones from oneplus are a notch above. Its true it doesn't have the best camera nor is the price justified. But trust me, the OS is enough to convince you to spend a little extra. There is no bloatware. Just smooth Oxygen OS experience. And yes the feel is premium ish.. its slim and light weight and thats the best part. Will make you want to lose that cover!Go for it! Its worth a shot in this segment.",Ankit Seth,Buy it for the OS and feel

   Been using this phone from last 5 days nowDespite all the negative reviews from all the tech reviewers. My experience with this device has been good till now.I feel this is the best device when it comes to User Experience.Back is plastic but does feel premium. Overall I feel this is a veey well balanced phone. Screen is amazing - 90hz 1080p amoled display.Camera is decent. Battery life is excellent. I am not a mobile gamer so so 750G works really fine for me. Calls quality also amazing. Bloatware and ad free experience are major pros for me. I think the only issue is with the pricing, they are charging a lil bit premium for the one plus brand and ad free experience.",chaitanya,Good Phone.
225,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the worst phone I have ever seen. Better to buy low range phone instead of this. I bought this phone 3 days back and it has sensor issue.

226,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad camera. You can say it's worst camera(front and rear both) at this price.(পটপটে প্লাস্টিক).Average battery backup. Sometimes battery drains too fast without doing anything.Decent fast charging.Bad build quality. Plastic back is very thin.Good display. Sound output is not bad. Oxygen OS is awesome.

227,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After searching alot for phones under 25k, I am at the point of Samsung f62, M51 , Poco x3, Iqoo z3 and finally Nord CE .Finally went with Nord CE.-The look and feel is so great and so premium.-Battery is good too but I feel it's draining a lil bit faster than I anticipated but can easily last a day or more(depends on usage)The important of all,. Camera quality is DISAPPOINTING. Seriously, the pictures are like some artificial images and contrast isn't right. Portrait mode is like you manually blurred the image. Very poor cam quality.I understand you have to cut down somewhere to provide at this rate but if you core edition, camera is core usage of modern era of phone operations.Better go for Poco x3 or MI 11 lite.",Soma Jagadeesh,Great phone with poor camera.
228,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been 3 days since I'm using the phone and it is buttery smooth! The battery is excellent too which charges really quickly and gives you more than 1 day of usage even with medium to heavy usage. The cameras are a great improvement since Nord and they remove natural color images. Even the nightscape mode is a blessing which removes shots under low light with pretty good clarity almost as close to a Pixel 4a if not there. Yes I've compared both the phones since I have both of them. The 90hz refresh rate makes the experience even more smooth and quick along with the beautiful display. Totally recommend this under 27k! I don't get why there's so much hate about this phone, I think OnePlus did a great job except the Alert slider which was missing and the Gorilla Glass protection.",Osborne Dias,An all-in-one power packed combo under 27k
229,4.0 out of 5 stars,"***** NOTE: If you previously owned a OnePlus phone (Op 6 or later) then it will be foolish of you to think that this phone is actually an upgrade over it.My Previous phone: POCO F1*****I never owned a OnePlus phone and below are my thoughts about it.*****1) DISPLAY:Pretty good. My previous phone had an IPS panel. So no complaints there. In-display fp reader is also pretty good.2) REFRESH RATE:Having refresh rate 90hz/120hz/144hz or blah blah doesn't make a difference for me as it is not distinguishable for a naked eye. These are just numbers to boost price. A 60hz panel is more than enough.3) BATTERY:Pretty good. Can easily last for more than 1 day usage on moderate usage. 30W Warp charge is too good4) OXYGEN OS:The main thing that made me consider this phone over any other smartphone. Almost stock android and zero bloatware. Clean experience when compared to MIUI. Also, consistency in regular updates. Overall the UI experience is an upgrade from my last phone. So definitely no complaints there.5) CAMERAS:It's not that great and not that bad so don't expect a pixel level quality from a mid range phone. It's decent to use. Don't go for this phone if your preference is good quality pictures.6) AUDIO:Overall good audio quality. More equalizer options could have been provided. I use it with OnePlus bullet wireless Z bluetooth headset and the quality is good and optimized for their branded headset. Mono speaker is also loud enough.7) GAMING:Good quality gaming can be expected from the 750G chip. For a casual gameplay experience it is good enough. Don't expect high fps gameplay with max settings on this chip.8) ALERT SLIDER:It's not a miss for me as I never used this in any of my previous phones.FINAL THOUGHTS:For me it has been a great experience using this OnePlus device mainly because of the OS and it's clean and fluid experience.",Saurabh,A great budget option for those who never used a OnePlus phone before!

   The phone is not that bad, believe me guys, I am using this phone (8gb Ram,128gb storage). Yes some features are missing from old OnePlus devices but overall it is good product.1. Battery - 4/5 - No drain issue found. You can not expect 1.5 days of battery backup with 4500 mAh capacity. Yes but 1 day is enough and we have 30 Watt charger.2. Performance -4/5 (I am able to play call of duty at 58 to 60fps. So not Flagship level performance but yes you can play games without performance lag).3. Display - 5/5 - Yes display is awesome. No issues found. 90hz is smooth.4. OnePlus ui 4.5/5 - Smooth experience , clean,  no adds and no bloatwares and according to your usage the ui recognise and then apps open quick.5. In display finger print lock 4/5 - Not slow as shown in youtube videos.6. Camera 3.5/5 - I would say not that bad. But at this price range it is good. Clicked photos take little time to process.7. Charging 4/5 - Not in 30 min but does charge within 40 min upto 68-70%. I would say it's okay. Not so bad.8. Build 3/5 - Plastic back but not bad. The only problem I feel is that it doesn't have gorilla glass protection. And side panel is also plastic. They have given cover and screen guard which is nicee.9 Heating 4/5 : I found no heating issue either. While charging, phone does get warm but it is normal and even all phones get warm a little bit. So this isn't an issue.10 Weight 5/5: light and handy.Speakers are not my concerns. Good loud quality and 3.5mm jack output is nice.You can do ""call recording"".I am an iPhone user but still this phone is nooot bad as shown in Youtube. So , Overall 4/5 for this phone.",Neel Suthar,A nice phone.
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm Writing this review after using the OnePlus Nord ce 5g after a week.I've Switched from Vivo V15pro to this OnePlus Nord CE 5G as I wanted to experience smooth, Best OS i.e., Oxygen OS.OnePlus bought it's best in this price range. Many are saying that it doesn't have Gorilla glass protection on the back & Front but still the Matte finish at the back gives the phone premium look & coming to front there's a dragon glass protection which is used in many mobiles including the recent Google pixel 4a. Coming to the camera quality the back camera which is powered by Omnivision 64 MP sensor gives the best quality which we can expect at this price range. Front camera too is giving it's best to give detailed images & the portrait effect is excellent after an update by OnePlus. Coming to sound quality speakers are performing really good & the sound is excellent if earphones are plugged in. Battery Charge too lasts good & charging is powered by 30t Warp charge which is performing great. Coming to graphics I've played COD & as refresh rate is 90hz it's really well & the variant I've purchased is 12GB/256GB Void Blue Color. Last but not least, *If u are a heavy user/Gamer this is not the correct mobile for you better go for the other brands.

Simply put it does not have the juice to warrant a 27k price tag. I found the UI clunky and slow. There were performance lags at places where a 12gb phone had no place belonging.

Disappointed with expectations.Pro:- excellent display- fast charging- lag free UI- excellent sound in speaker and in headphones- clean OS- good quality case providedCons:- poor camera. If you are looking for good camera, don't go for this. My 5 years old One Plus X has far better camera quality. Camera has very basic limited options, the same I have in One Plus X. Nothing new. All images captured have central focus, at edges, images are blur, like I had issues in my Canon camera after dropped from table.- camera flash has highly yellowish tint, not white light expected from LED. Not expected as per price tag set. Feeling like cheap phone with poor flash.- battery capacity under the expectations. With 90 Hz refresh rate, battery rating not justified.Battery drops drastically like 1% per 10 min,whether you use or not. Keep charger handy, if you use more.Overall, I just wanted to upgrade my old One Plus X to have a better camera, but their I failed on assumptions that after five years, One Plus would have better camera, which did not turn into reality.

270,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have bought One Plus for the first time. But feel a bit disappointed.  The premium look cannot be a substitute for the real performance. The biggest pain point is the fast draining battery of this phone. Be careful while you buy this one. While some rumors r there that the company might soon come out with a fix. But till then one has to bear with it.,Sachin Agarwal,Battery is a big pain point of this phone.
